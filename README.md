# Portfolio API [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PedroOkawa/repo-start.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PedroOkawa/repo-start)

This is an experiment (Because It's my first time implementing API's, I've never programmed with JavaScript, NodeJS and MongoDB).

This API allow users to:

* Register as an user
* Login
* Upload portfolios
* Request your own portfolios

Fell free to contact and/or help me if see something that's terribly developed. :D
